        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <section class= 'p1'> <p>
            Hello and welcome! My name is Aubrey Corsetti, I am 27 years old and paving my way into the tech 
            world. I grew up in Montana and Washington state. I graduated High School from Monroe WA in 2013. 
            Since highschool I have had jobs that ranged from being a manager at Subway to building photometers
             from a third party company to test LCD, LED etc screens for NASA and the military. My most current 
             position was being a solar saleswoman for a company called Blue Raven Solar.

             <section class= 'p2'><p>My hobbies include; 
             archery (I used to compete), painting, hiking and cooking. I am currently based in Seattle,WA with my two dogs Yetti 
             and Kalua. The goals I have for myself is to graduate from Code Fellows in February 2023 and become
              a UI Designer for Nike or Target. I also have been working on a high end luggage line that I hope to 
              release in the next 5 years. Most of my family is from Holland and Italy, I am the second generation born in the United States so I take my heritage very 
              seriously and keep my family values close to my heart.
